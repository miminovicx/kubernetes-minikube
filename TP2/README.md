# CodingWithKubernetes

How to code a web app composed of two web services:
- a frontend
- a backend

# Prerequisite

This tutorial assume that you have already installed Kubernetes. If not, follow this other tutorial: https://github.com/charroux/kubernetes

# The backend app

The backend is coded in Java (Spring boot), but it doesn't matter. The Web service simply return "World !" when it receives an HTTP Get on "/hello": https://github.com/charroux/CodingWithKubernetes/blob/master/BackEnd/src/main/java/com/example/BackEnd/MyWebService.java

A Docker image is already available is the docker hub at: https://hub.docker.com/u/efrei, and this tutorial uses it. But feel free to rebuild it. All the code plus the Dockerfile are there: https://github.com/charroux/CodingWithKubernetes/tree/master/BackEnd

# The frontend app

The frontend (also coded in Java Spring boot) waits for an HTTP get on "/". Then it requests the backend service:

```
restTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
String s = restTemplate.getForObject(backEndURL, String.class);
```

and concatenates and returns the result "World !" with "Hello": 

```
return "hello (from the front end)" + " " + s + " (from the back end)";
```

# Kubernestes configuration file

A single yaml file is enough to configure the cluster: https://github.com/charroux/CodingWithKubernetes/blob/master/front-back-app.yml

Note first of all how configurations are separated from each other with ---

This yaml file contains:

## The frontend deployment

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: front-end-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: front-end
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: front-end
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: front-end-container
        image: efrei/front-end:1
        imagePullPolicy: Always
```

Note the last line "imagePullPolicy: Always". Hence, each time the deployement is done, the image is pulled from the Docker hub. Which is usefull at development stage. The other choices are 
- without imagePullPolicy and :latest as the image tag
- wihtout imagePullPolicy and specify the imahe tag

## The frontend service in front of the deployment

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: front-end-service
spec:
  ports:
    - name: http
      targetPort: 8080
      port: 80
  selector:
app: front-end
```
where targetPort is the port used by the frontend web service.

## The backend deployment

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: back-end-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: back-end
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: back-end
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: back-end-container
          image: efrei/back-end:1   
          imagePullPolicy: Always
```          

## The backend service in front of the deployment

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: back-end-service
spec:
  ports:
    - name: http
      targetPort: 8080
      port: 80
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
app: back-end
```
Notice the type set to ClusterIP. A Kubernetes Service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods running somewhere in the cluster, that all provide the same functionality. When created, each Service is assigned a unique IP address (also called clusterIP). This address is tied to the lifespan of the Service, and will not change while the Service is alive.

## Service discovery: how the frontend can reache the backend ?

Kubernetes supports 2 primary modes of finding a Service - environment variables and DNS (Domain Name Server). The former works out of the box while the latter requires the CoreDNS cluster addon.


Using environment variables: when a Pod runs on a Node, the kubelet adds a set of environment variables for each active Service:
```
kubectl exec podsName -- printenv | grep SERVICE
```

where podsName is obtained with: 
```
kubectl get pods
```
```
NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
back-end-deployment-5dbf4f845c-hpszd    1/1     Running   0          3h50m
front-end-deployment-666cbf7cb9-lz44d   1/1     Running   0          3h50m
```

Those variables are : 
- SERVICE_NAME_SERVICE_HOST 
- SERVICE_NAME_SERVICE_PORT

Using DNS: Kubernetes offers a DNS cluster addon Service that automatically assigns dns names to other Services. You can check if itâ€™s running on your cluster:

```
kubectl get services kube-dns --namespace=kube-system
```
```
NAME       TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                  AGE
kube-dns   ClusterIP   10.43.0.10   <none>        53/UDP,53/TCP,9153/TCP   3d3h
```

Aa soon as the DNS service is running, the frontend app can aks the DNS to resolv the backend address. Apps sometimes store such address as constants in the code. This is a violation of twelve-factor (https://12factor.net/). Here, this address is stored in a property files of the frontend: https://github.com/charroux/CodingWithKubernetes/blob/master/FrontEnd/src/main/resources/application.yml

The pattern to build such Kubernetes address is: <service_name>.<name_space>.svc.<cluster_name>:<ClusterIP port>
  
  As you can see is the property file:
  - service_name: back-end-service
  - name_space: default
  - cluster_name: cluster.local
  - ClusterIP port: 80/hello
  
The backend address is injected inside the frontend app (https://github.com/charroux/CodingWithKubernetes/blob/master/FrontEnd/src/main/java/com/example/FrontEnd/MyWebService.java) with:
```
@Value("${backEndURL}")
String backEndURL;
```
  
## Test the app from a Web browser

Since the kind of the front-end service is NodePort you can get its IP address with: 
```
minikube service front-end-service --url 
```

Then test the app with a Web browser.

## The configuration of the ingress controller 

This part will not work with the latest version of Minikube which doesn't support Ingress. 


Go back to the previous tutorial to discover why an Ingress controller is useful: https://github.com/charroux/kubernetes

```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: front-end-ingress
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: traefik
spec:
  rules:
    - host: front-end.localhost
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            backend:
              serviceName: front-end-service
              servicePort: http
```
It uses Traefik as the Ingress controller (See https://github.com/charroux/kubernetes) 

## Launching the deployment

```
kubectl apply -f front-back-app.yml
```

Check if all resources are available: 
```
kubectl get all
```
```
NAME                                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/back-end-deployment-5dbf4f845c-hpszd    1/1     Running   0          3h17m
pod/front-end-deployment-666cbf7cb9-lz44d   1/1     Running   0          3h17m

NAME                        TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
service/kubernetes          ClusterIP   10.43.0.1      <none>        443/TCP   3d2h
service/front-end-service   ClusterIP   10.43.18.233   <none>        80/TCP    3h17m
service/back-end-service    ClusterIP   10.43.22.135   <none>        80/TCP    3h17m

NAME                                   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/back-end-deployment    1/1     1            1           3h17m
deployment.apps/front-end-deployment   1/1     1            1           3h17m

NAME                                              DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
replicaset.apps/back-end-deployment-5dbf4f845c    1         1         1       3h17m
replicaset.apps/front-end-deployment-666cbf7cb9   1         1         1       3h17m
```

Retreive the Ingress controller state: 
```
kubectl get ingress
```

```
NAME                HOSTS                 ADDRESS     PORTS   AGE
front-end-ingress   front-end.localhost   10.0.2.15   80      3h51m
```

Get the clusterIP with: 
```
kubectl get back-end-service
```

Pods are exposed through endpoints:
```
kubectl get ep back-end-service
```

```
NAME               ENDPOINTS          AGE
back-end-service   10.42.0.121:8080   3h46m
```

Test the apps in your web browser at this URL: http://front-end.localhost/

Where front-end.localhost has been set in the above Ingress configuration.

## Behind the scene

Lauch the Shell inside the frontend container:
```
kubectl exec -it deployment.apps/back-end-deployment sh
```

deployment.apps/back-end-deployment comes from: kubectl get all

Where "kubectl exec" runs the command interpreter "sh", -it for the interactive mode.

Then ask the DNS to solve the backend address with:
```
nslookup back-end-service
``` 
```
Name:      back-end-service
Address 1: 10.43.22.135 back-end-service.default.svc.cluster.local
```
Now check again the Spring property file for the frontand app: https://github.com/charroux/CodingWithKubernetes/blob/master/FrontEnd/src/main/resources/application.yml

It matches !

Those information comes from a file. Get its content:
```
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```
It displays:
```
search default.svc.cluster.local svc.cluster.local cluster.local
nameserver 10.43.0.10
options ndots:5
```

## Delete resources

Delete the deployments and associated services: 
```
kubectl delete deployment.apps/front-end-deployment service/front-end-service deployment.apps/back-end-deployment service/back-end-service
```
Delete the Ingress controller: 
```
kubectl delete ingress front-end-ingress --namespace default
```
